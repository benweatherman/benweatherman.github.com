fix the selected item nav, so that it actually works. cause that would make sense.

maybe make the excerpt/truncation better if you want that.

if you want code snippet pages and notes/links pages, maybe make that all work. i figured code might just be a list of posts that include code snippets. notes might be things that are too big for twitter but not really post-worthy. links are, obvs, useful links.

i just wrote some stuff on the about page so there was content but obvs do whatever.

some other stuff i wanted to do but haven't yet:

* add a little ordoro icon by the Ordoro name on the about page
* actually make the color switcher work between pages, if you care about that
* give you a cool font for your name, with a neat coding-looking ampersand. i was gonna do this but i didn't know if you'd prefer typekit, google web font, image, whatev. 
* custom font all over? just for nav/header?
* add permalink icon
* add note icon vs link icon
* find a picture of fatchops because apparently there isn't a single one on the whole internet now that we're no longer on facebook.
* make responsive stuff possibly more interesting and test on some actual phones
